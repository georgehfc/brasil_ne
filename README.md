Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

BRASIL-NE is a test-drive project. With a little help from my friends,
it's an AirBnb clone but now with movies. More specifically: Northeast Brazil
movies.

Enjoy!
